# 🔍 Summary: Real-Time Edge AI for Crop Segmentation with Dynamic Pruning

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Modern precision agriculture increasingly relies on deep learning models for plant detection, segmentation, and monitoring. However, these models are typically:

* Large in size
* Computationally intensive
* Designed for cloud-based inference

Such requirements **do not align** with the realities of deployment in rural or remote agricultural fields where:

* Network connectivity is poor or intermittent
* Compute resources are limited
* Power constraints restrict the use of high-wattage GPUs

This creates a critical deployment bottleneck: How can we run powerful segmentation models in real time on lightweight, edge AI devices like Jetson Xavier AGX, without sacrificing accuracy or speed?

## ❗ Research Gap

Despite advances in lightweight architectures (e.g., YOLOv8), these models still suffer from:

* Redundant computations in fixed-parameter networks
* Lack of adaptability to scene complexity
* Inability to dynamically adjust based on input characteristics
* Inefficient compression that often requires retraining and can degrade performance

No existing mainstream pipeline provides:

* Entropy-aware, scenario-specific model pruning
* Fine-tuning-free deployment-ready optimization
* An inference stack tailored for **real-world field deployments in agriculture

## ✅ Our Solution: A Dynamic, Deployment-Centric Edge AI Pipeline

This repository delivers an end-to-end, modular AI solution built specifically for real-time crop segmentation on edge devices. The solution is characterized by:

### 1. 🧠 Intelligent, Input-Aware Pruning

* Utilizes F2Zip pruning, which:

  * Analyzes each image’s entropy to assess scene complexity
  * Scores channel importance without backpropagation
  * Uses a multi-constraint knapsack solver to prune model channels dynamically
* Ensures that important features are preserved while compressing redundant capacity

### 2. 🚀 Edge-Ready Model Conversion & Deployment

* Models are trained in PyTorch → converted to ONNX → optimized via TensorRT
* Final deployment targets NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier 32GB
* Achieves >30 FPS inference on real aerial video footage

### 3. 🧩 Modular Inference Interface

* Supports:

  * Static image segmentation
  * Real-time drone/video segmentation
  * Inference modules use Ultralytics' YOLOv8-Seg API + OpenCV rendering
